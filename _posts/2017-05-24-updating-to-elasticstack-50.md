### Updating Logstash, ElasticSearch, and Kibana to 5.0

I had the following versions installed of the ELK (**elasticsearch**,**logstash**,**kibana**) Stack:

	<> rpm -qa | grep -iE 'kibana|elastic|logst'
	logstash-2.3.4-1.noarch
	elasticsearch-2.4.1-1.noarch
	kibana-4.5.4-1.x86_64

I read over the [Upgrading the Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack/current/upgrading-elastic-stack.html), and here is the recommended update order:

> 1. Elasticsearch Hadoop (can talk to Elasticsearch 5.0 and 2.x)
> 2. Elasticsearch
> 	* X-Pack for Elasticsearch (combines Marvel Agent, Shield, Watcher, and Graph)
> 3. Kibana (now includes Timelion and Console, formerly known as Sense)
> 	* X-Pack for Kibana (combines Marvel, Shield, Graph, and Reporting)
> 4. Logstash
> 5. Beats

Let's try it out.

### Updating ElasticSearch from 2.4 to 5.0

Reading over [Upgrading Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.0/setup-upgrade.html) there is a table of suggested updates.

![es-update-table](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/update-es-50/es-update-table.png&raw=1)

I think the biggest concern is whether you need to reindex old indices. I was on **elasticsearch** 2.4 and I was using **logstash**'s time based indices so I didn't need to worry about that (I also used [curator](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/examples.html) to delete old indices):

	<> curl 'localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v'
	health status index               pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
	yellow open   logstash-2016.10.22   5   1     172206            0     66.1mb         66.1mb
	yellow open   logstash-2016.10.23   5   1     237647            0     86.8mb         86.8mb
	yellow open   logstash-2016.10.24   5   1    1834855            0 
       62.7mb         62.7mb
    ...
	yellow open   .kibana               1   1         46            1       63kb           63kb
	yellow open   logstash-2016.10.05   5   1     135822            0     58.4mb         58.4mb
	
So I didn't worry about the **re-index and update** approach. I then stopped **logstash** and **kibana** in preparation for the update:

	<> sudo systemctl stop logstash.service
	<> sudo systemctl stop kibana

After that I went to the [Full cluster restart upgrade](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.0/restart-upgrade.html) page and started the update. First **disable shard allocation**:

	<> curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_cluster/settings?pretty' -d'
	 > {
	 >   "persistent": {
	 >     "cluster.routing.allocation.enable": "none"
	 >   }
	 > }'
	{
	  "acknowledged" : true,
	  "persistent" : {
	    "cluster" : {
	      "routing" : {
	        "allocation" : {
	          "enable" : "none"
	        }
	      }
	    }
	  },
	  "transient" : { }
	}

Next **perform a synced flush**:

	<> curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/_flush/synced?pretty'
	{
	  "_shards" : {
	    "total" : 552,
	    "successful" : 276,
	    "failed" : 0
	  },
	  "logstash-2016.10.22" : {
	    "total" : 10,
	    "successful" : 5,
	    "failed" : 0
	  },
	  "logstash-2016.10.23" : {
	    "total" : 10,
	    "successful" : 5,
	    "failed" : 0
	  },
		...
	  },
	  ".kibana" : {
	    "total" : 2,
	    "successful" : 1,
	    "failed" : 0
	  },
	}

Now let's shutdown the node.

	<> sudo systemctl stop elasticsearch.service

And then we can check out the [Install Elasticsearch with RPM](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.0/rpm.html) page. We just
need to update our repo file to look like this:

	<> cat /etc/yum.repos.d/es.repo
	[elasticsearch-5.x]
	name=Elasticsearch repository for 5.x packages
	baseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/5.x/yum
	gpgcheck=1
	gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
	enabled=1
	autorefresh=1
	type=rpm-md

and import the GPG key:

	<> sudo rpm --import https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch

And now for the update:

	<> sudo yum update elasticsearch

	Updated:
	  elasticsearch.noarch 0:5.0.0-1
	
	Complete!

I didn't have any plugins so at this point I just started the service back up:

	<> sudo systemctl daemon-reload
	<> sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service
	<> sudo journalctl -fu elasticsearch.service
	-- Logs begin at Wed 2016-10-26 07:23:03 MDT. --

	Oct 29 14:35:00 puppet.kar.int systemd[1]: Starting Elasticsearch...
	Oct 29 14:35:00 puppet.kar.int systemd[1]: Started Elasticsearch.

Then we can check out the status:

	<> curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/_cat/health?pretty'
	1477773428 14:37:08 elasticsearch yellow 1 1 276 276 0 0 276 0 - 50.0%
	
	<> curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/_cat/nodes?pretty'
	127.0.0.1 23 97 19 0.48 0.38 0.28 mdi * NVsq0kL

and then we can confirm the indices are okay as well:

	<> curl 'localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v'
	health status index               uuid                   pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size

	...
	yellow open   .kibana             m4qTcJx4TKi9zxZaWufOoA   1   1         46            1       63kb           63kb
	...
	yellow open   logstash-2016.09.30 9Ayf0BgRS6mvVtoW_f_oNw   5   1     143003            0       67mb           67mb

Now let's renabled allocation:

	<> curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_cluster/settings?pretty' -d'
	 > {
	 >   "persistent": {
	 >     "cluster.routing.allocation.enable": "all"
	 >   }
	 > }'
	{
	  "acknowledged" : true,
	  "persistent" : {
	    "cluster" : {
	      "routing" : {
	        "allocation" : {
	          "enable" : "all"
	        }
	      }
	    }
	  },
	  "transient" : { }
	}

You can also confirm the version of **elasticsearch**:

	<> curl -XGET 'localhost:9200'
	{
	  "name" : "NVsq0kL",
	  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
	  "cluster_uuid" : "E4lDuM2KRH-Mi11k_7jiKQ",
	  "version" : {
	    "number" : "5.0.0",
	    "build_hash" : "253032b",
	    "build_date" : "2016-10-26T04:37:51.531Z",
	    "build_snapshot" : false,
	    "lucene_version" : "6.2.0"
	  },
	  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
	}

### Updating Kibana from 4.5 to 5.0

I read over [Upgrading Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/5.0/upgrade.html) and checking out the table, I can just do a **standard** upgrade without doing a re-index (since I was using **logstash**'s time based indices):

![kib-update-table](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/update-es-50/kib-update-table.png&raw=1)

I started using Kibana from 4.3 and above (you can check out the original setup that I did [here](/2016/02/playing-around-with-an-elasticsearchlogstashkibana-elk-stack/)) so I was good. The steps for the update are layed out
in the [Standard Upgrade](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/5.0/upgrade-standard.html) page. First you stop the **kibana** instance, which I did above. Then install the rpm, since **elasticsearch** and **kibana** share the repo, I didn't have to do anything special.  Then I performed the update:

	<> sudo yum update kibana
	[sudo] password for elatov:

	Updated:
	  kibana.x86_64 0:5.0.0-1
	
	Complete!

Then I went ahead and copied the config over:

	<> sudo cp /etc/kibana/kibana.yml /etc/kibana/kibana.yml.orig
	<> sudo cp /opt/kibana/config/kibana.yml.rpmsave /etc/kibana/kibana.yml

I didn't have any plugins for **kibana** so I just started up the service:

	<> sudo systemctl daemon-reload
	<> sudo systemctl start kibana.service
	<> sudo journalctl -fu kibana

Then you can point your browser to the **kibana** dashboard and see the new

### Updating Logstash from 2.3 to 5.0

I read over [Upgrading Logstash to 5.0](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/upgrading-logstash-5.0.html) and I didn't see anything bad about the update. Then I followed the instructions laid out in [Upgrading Using Package Managers](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/upgrading-using-package-managers.html) to do the update. First stop **logstash**, which I did above. Then add the repo, which I did during the **elasticsearch** update. And then I updated the package:

	<> sudo yum update

	Updated:

	Complete!

Then I confirmed the config file is okay:

	<> sudo /usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash --config.test_and_exit --path.settings=/etc/logstash/ -f /etc/logstash/conf.d/logstash-syslog.conf
	Sending Logstash logs to /var/log/logstash which is now configured via log4j2.properties.
	Configuration OK

Now let's start the service:

	<> sudo systemctl daemon-reload
	<> sudo systemctl start logstash.service
	<> sudo journalctl -fu logstash.service
	-- Logs begin at Wed 2016-10-26 07:23:03 MDT. --

I used to use the **stdout** output module, but with 5.0 that ended up logging to **syslog** and **journalctl**, so I changed that to be **file** instead of **stdout**:

	<> tail -3 /etc/logstash/conf.d/logstash-syslog.conf
	  file { path => "/var/log/logstash/logstash-syslog.log" codec => rubydebug }
	#  stdout { codec => rubydebug }
	}

Then one more restart:

	<> sudo systemctl restart logstash

and I saw the logs under **/var/log/logstash/logstash-syslog.log** and not under **/var/log/messages**. I had to re-add the **logrotate** config back since the rpm install removed it. Also with the new version there is an API now available on **logstash**, so you could check out the version like this:

	<> curl "127.0.0.1:9600/?pretty"
	{
	  "host" : "puppet.kar.int",
	  "version" : "5.0.0",
	  "http_address" : "127.0.0.1:9600",
	  "build_date" : "2016-10-26T04:09:44Z",
	  "build_sha" : "6ffe6451db6a0157cc6dd23458a0342c3118a9b0",
	  "build_snapshot" : false
	}%

### Post Upgrade Changes
I ended up lowering the memory usage for the **logstash** and **elasticsearch** java instances:

	<> grep -iE '^\-Xms|^\-Xmx' /etc/logstash/jvm.options /etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options
	/etc/logstash/jvm.options:-Xms256m
	/etc/logstash/jvm.options:-Xmx512m
	/etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options:-Xms768m
	/etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options:-Xmx768m

Also my **logstash** config kept failing to do geoip lookup on internal IPs. I had the setup that's covered [here](http://elatov.github.io/2016/04/suricata-logs-in-splunk-and-elk/) which didn't do geoip lookups on internal IPs. I had to move the *src_ip* **if** loop inside the first if statement that checked if it's a **SuricataIDPS** type. After that the geoip started working appropriately. I feels like the **filter** option is now globally applied to all the inputs not just within the config file.
