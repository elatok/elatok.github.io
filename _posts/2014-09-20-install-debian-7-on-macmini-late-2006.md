A very old Mac Mini came into my hands, in fact it was so old that the latest version of Mac OS X that it could run was 10.6 and I couldn't even update it to 10.9. So I decided to install Debian on the machine in the hopes of using it as a media server later on. Here are the steps I took to install Debian 7.6 on the MacMini1,1.

### Reset Local Mac OS X User's Password
I didn't even have the login information for the local admin user. To reset the password on Mac OS X 10.6 we can do the following. Power on the MacMini and as soon as you hear the boot chime hold **Apple+S** (or some refer to it as **Command+S**), this will force the machine to boot into *single-user* mode. It will ask you to run a file system check and to remount the file system with read/write permission. The commands for that are as follows:

	/sbin/fsck -y
	/sbin/mount -uw /

Here is how that looks like:

![mac-os-x-sum-fsck-and-mount](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/mac-mini-2006-debian/mac-os-x-sum-fsck-and-mount.png&raw=1)

After that, we can run the following to launch the user Directory service:

	launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DirectoryServices.plist

Then run the following to see a list of available users on the system:

	ls /Users

Then finally run the following to set a desired password for a user of your choice:

	dscl . -passwd /Users/USER PASSWORD 
	
After that you should be all set, just reboot into regular mode:

	reboot
	
### Download and Burn the Debian ISO
I just grabbed the net-boot ISO:

	elatov@fed:~$ls -l downloads/*.iso
	-rw-r----- 1 elatov elatov 290455552 Sep 20 09:55 downloads/debian-7.6.0-i386-netinst.iso
	
And burned it onto an empty CD using my Fedora Laptop:

	elatov@fed:~$wodim dev=/dev/sr0 --devices
	wodim: Overview of accessible drives (1 found) :
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 0  dev='/dev/sr0'	rwrw-- : 'MATSHITA' 'DVD+-RW UJ892'
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
So my **/dev/sr0** drive will be able to handle the burning of a blank CD. Now for the actual command to burn the ISO:

	elatov@fed:~$wodim -v dev=/dev/sr0 speed=4 -eject downloads/debian-7.6.0-i386-netinst.iso 

### Download and Copy rEFIt ISO Disk Image onto a USB drive
While the CD was burning I went to the Mac and first made sure the password was reset. Then I installed the **rEFIt** image on my USB Drive, so I can boot from it later. I could've probably used the **diskutility** to complete this, but I decided to go with the command line. I just grabbed the ISO disk image and ran the following:

	gunzip -d rEFIt-0.14.cdr.gz
	hdiutil convert -format UDRW -o refit.dmg rEFIt-0.14.cdr
	sudo dd if=refit.dmg of=/dev/disk1
	
As soon as the **dd** finished the volume auto mounted and I saw the **rEFIt** icon.

### Mute the Boot Chime from OS X
While I was in OS X, I took the chance to silence the boot chime, here is the command for that:

	$ sudo nvram SystemAudioVolume=%80

You can confirm the setting by running the following:

	$ sudo nvram -p | grep Audio
	SystemAudioVolume	%80

After that I rebooted and I didn't hear the boot chime.
	
### Use DiskUtility to Create a Partition for Debian
Just fire up **DiskUtility** and resize the partition (I covered this in a [previous](/2013/08/install-fedora-19-on-mac-book-pro/) post)
	
### Boot from the Debian CD and Install Debian on the Free Space
I decided to dual boot just in case I ever needed to reboot into Mac OS for updates or firmware updates. So reboot from Mac OS X and hold down the **Alt** key and it will show you the boot manager. On the boot manager the Debian CD will show up with a title of **Windows**:

![mac-osx-boot-man-cd-selected2](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/mac-mini-2006-debian/mac-osx-boot-man-cd-selected2_gc.jpg&raw=1)

If you select the CD, it will start the Debian Installer. Just fill out everything as you normally would. I selected the "**Guided - use the largest continuous free space**":

![deb-in-part-guided_g](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/mac-mini-2006-debian/deb-in-part-guided_g.jpg&raw=1)

After selecting that it created the following partitions:

![deb-in-part-guided2](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/mac-mini-2006-debian/deb-in-part-guided2_gc.jpg&raw=1)

It will also ask you where to install GRUB and I selected the fourth partition (**/dev/sda4**):

![deb-in-grub-spec-disk_g](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/mac-mini-2006-debian/deb-in-grub-spec-disk_g.jpg&raw=1)

After the install is finished it will eject the CD and reboot. Before rebooting insert the USB drive that has **rEFIt** on it.

### Sync MBR with GPT
When the Mac is rebooting keep pressing the **Alt** key until you see the boot manager, since you have the USB stick plugged in, you will see the **rEFIt** icon:

![osx-boot-man-refit_g](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/mac-mini-2006-debian/osx-boot-man-refit_g.jpg&raw=1)

After booting from the **rEFIt** USB stick, you will see both your OS X and Linux Boot Disks:

![refit-linux-selected_g](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/mac-mini-2006-debian/refit-linux-selected_g.jpg&raw=1)

Scroll down and select the **shell**:

![refit-shell-selected_g](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/mac-mini-2006-debian/refit-shell-selected_g.jpg&raw=1)

After the shell is started just run **gptsync.efi**, here is how it will look like:

![refit-gptsync-change_g.jpg](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/mac-mini-2006-debian/refit-gptsync-change_g.jpg&raw=1)

Here is the full output, just for reference:

	shell>gptsync.efi

	Current GPT partition table:
	 #     Start LBA     End LBA 	Type
	 1            40      409639	 EFI System (FAT)
	 2        409640    78490383	 Mac OS X HFS+
	 3      78491648    78493695	 GRUB2 BIOS Boot
	 4      78493696   115535871	 Basic Data
	 5     115535872   117209087     Linux Swap

	Current MBR partition tab:
	 # A   Start LBA     End LBA  Type
	 1             1   117210239  EE EFI Protective

	 Status: MRB Table must be updated

	Proposed new MBR partition table:
	 # Ä„   Start LBA     End LBA 	 Type
	 1             1       409639 	EE EFI Protective
	 2        409640     78490383 	AF Mac OS X HFS+
	 3      78491648     78493695 	C0 Unknown
	 4      78493696    115535871 	83 Linux

	May I update the MBR as printed above? [y/N] Yes

	Writing new MBR...
	MBR updated successfully!

	* Hit any key to continue *

Type **exit** to leave the **rEFIt** shell.

### Reboot into Debian
Reboot from the **rEFIt** USB disk and eject the USB disk, then hold down the **Alt** key and now you will see the new **Windows** Disk which is the Debian GRUB Boot loader:

![mac-osx-boot-man-deb-selected_g](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/mac-mini-2006-debian/mac-osx-boot-man-deb-selected_g.jpg&raw=1)

Upon selecting the **Windows** boot disk, you will see the GRUB menu with the Debian entry:

![deb-grub_g](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/mac-mini-2006-debian/deb-grub_g.jpg&raw=1)

After that Debian will boot up normally.

### Set Debian as the default boot disk
If you don't want to keep pushing the **Alt** key to boot into Debian, we can **bless** our Debian paritition from Mac OS X. First list all the partitions to figure out which partition we need to **bless**:

	$ diskutil list
	/dev/disk0
	   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
	   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *60.0 GB    disk0
	   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1
	   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            40.0 GB    disk0s2
	   3: 21686148-6449-6E6F-744E-65656445                   1.0 MB     disk0s3
	   4:       Microsoft Basic Data                         19.0 GB    disk0s4
	   5:                 Linux Swap                         856.7 MB   disk0s5
	   
It's still partition 4, so let's just run the following to **bless** that guy:

	$ sudo bless --device /dev/disk0s4 --setBoot --legacy --verbose
	..
	...
	Setting EFI NVRAM:
		efi-boot-device='<array><dict><key>IOEFIDevicePathType</key><string>HardwareMemoryMapped</string><key>EndingAddress</key><integer size="64">0xfff9ffff</integer><key>MemoryType</key><integer size="32">0xb</integer><key>StartingAddress</key><integer size="64">0xffe00000</integer></dict><dict><key>Guid</key><string>2B0585EB-D8B8-49A9-8B8C-E21B01AEF2B7</string><key>IOEFIDevicePathType</key><string>MediaFirmwareVolumeFilePath</string></dict><dict><key>IOEFIBootOption</key><string>HD</string></dict></array>'
	Setting EFI NVRAM:
		IONVRAM-DELETE-PROPERTY='efi-boot-file'
	Setting EFI NVRAM:
		IONVRAM-DELETE-PROPERTY='efi-boot-mkext'
	Old boot-args: (null)
		Got token: (null)
		Preserving: (null)
	Setting EFI NVRAM:
		boot-args='(null)'
		
Then after that if you reboot, it will automatically boot into Debian.

### Create a Recovery 10.7 USB Disk
Although this won't help with this old Mac Mini, but I noticed that it's installed on this Mac, so I thought it would come in handy. Starting with 10.7 the image is included with the **Mountain Lion Install App**. So I first copied the DMG from the Application Folder onto a USB stick:

	$ rsync -avzP /Applications/ Install Mac OS X Mountain Lion.app/Resources/Shared Support/InstallESD.dmg /Volumes/Untitled/.

Then plug that USB disk into a Linux box and we can start the conversion. I ran into [this](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/197403-converting-os-x-106dmg-to-iso-using-dmg2img/) page which mentions that the **InstallESD.dmg** file is not a valid DMG file and we have to use **7zip** to extract it. So let's extract that file:

	$7z x InstallESD.dmg

	7-Zip [64] 9.20  Copyright (c) 1999-2010 Igor Pavlov  2010-11-18

	Everything is Ok

	Folders: 32
	Files: 67
	Size:       4180898338
	Compressed: 4179961589

Now we can convert the actual DMG into an ISO:

	$cd InstallMacOSX.pkg/
	$dmg2img -v -i InstallESD.dmg -o InstallESD.iso

	dmg2img v1.6.2 is derived from dmg2iso by vu1tur (to@vu1tur.eu.org)

	InstallESD.dmg --> InstallESD.iso

	reading property list, 971484 bytes from address 4167740795 ...

	partition 1: begin=914, size=430, decoded=284
	partition 2: begin=1632, size=430, decoded=284
	partition 3: begin=2367, size=430, decoded=284

	opening partition 4 ...         [2] 100.00%  ok
	opening partition 5 ...     [16177] 100.00%  ok

	Archive successfully decompressed as InstallESD.iso

	You should be able to mount the image [as root] by:

Now we can use **dd** to install that ISO on a USB Stick:

	$sudo dd if=InstallMacOSX.pkg/InstallESD.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=1M
	4397+1 records in
	4397+1 records out
	4611469312 bytes (4.6 GB) copied, 1009.75 s, 4.6 MB/s

Plugging that into another Mac that handle OS 10.7 and you can use it for recovery tools. Also if you wanted to, you could use **DiskUtility** in Mac OS X to perform the same procedure. The steps are laid out [here](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/apple-in-the-enterprise/how-to-create-a-bootable-usb-to-install-os-x/).
