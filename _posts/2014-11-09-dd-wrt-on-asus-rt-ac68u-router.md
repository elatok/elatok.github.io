Got myself a new router, didn't really need one, but got one just for the heck of it. So of course the first thing I did is put DD-WRT on it.

### DD-WRT Firmware for the ASUS RT-AC68U

Looking over the [following](http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=177612&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=810) thread, it looks like at the time of writing (Nov 1st 2014) the **24461** firmware seems pretty stable. 

With the ASUS router it's a two step process to get DD-WRT on it, first we flash it with the BrainSlayer Firmware (**.trx** file) and then we update to the lastest Kong Build of DD-WRT (**.bin** file). For the Kong DD-WRT build I grabbed the [25015M](http://www.desipro.de/ddwrt-ren/K3-AC-Arm/25015M/dd-wrt.v24-K3_AC_ARM_STD.bin) version (other people had luck with it) and  the [Supported Models document](http://www.desipro.de/ddwrt-ren/K3-AC-Arm/25015M/Supported%20Models.txt) had the **AC68U** Router listed.

### DD-WRT Install Process

There is a pretty good [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG3fVNT18Pc) video on how to install DD-WRT on the **RT-AC66U** Router. The process they went through was like this:

1. Enable Telnet on the Router
2. Telnet into the router
3. Flash the NVRAM -- `mtd-erase -d nvram`
4. Then reboot the router -- `reboot`
5. Re-open the admin page (http://192.168.1.1)
6. Upload the initial dd-wrt firmware (Brainslayer) **Administration** -> **Firmware Upgrade** upload the **trx** file
7. Enable telnet in dd-wrt
8. Telnet back into the router, flash the nvram -- `clear nvram / erase nvram`
9. Reboot -- `reboot`
10. Upload the K3 Firmware **bin** file under **Administration** -> **Firmware upgrade**

There are also good instructions [here](http://miketabor.com/installing-dd-wrt-asus-rt-ac66u-router/) and there is also a [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/DDWRT/comments/2hlzjx/how_do_i_flash_a_asus_rtac68u/) page on it as well.


#### Flash the NVRAM on the ASUS Router

Here is what I did to clear the NVRAM on  the Stock Install:

	elatov@crbook:~$telnet 192.168.1.1

	admin@RT-AC68U:/tmp/home/root# reboot
	admin@RT-AC68U:/tmp/home/root# Connection closed by foreign host

We can see that the router actually runs AsusWRT, I actually ran into a custom version of AsusWRT, it's called **AsusWRT Merlin**:

- [asuswrt-merlin Git](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin)
- [Asuswrt-Merlin Download](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/bkfq2a6aebq68//Asuswrt-Merlin)
- [Asuswrt-Merlin - custom firmware for Asus routers](http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/forums/showthread.php?t=7846)

It looks pretty cool and a lot of people prefer to run that on the ASUS routers, cause the firmware is so close to the manufacturer one (the performance seems good). If I ever get tired of DD-WRT, I will definitely give AsusWRT Merlin a try.

#### Flash the Router with the BrainSlayer Firmware

After the router rebooted (after I flashed the NVRAM), I went back to the Management console (http://192.168.1.1) and navigated to  **Administration** -> **Firmware Upgrade** and uploaded the **asus_rt-ac68u-firmware.trx** file:

![rtx-upload-asus](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/asus-dd-wrt/rtx-upload-asus.png&raw=1)

Upon hitting **upload** the upgrade will start and after it's done you will see the following:

![firmware-update-done](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/asus-dd-wrt/firmware-update-done.png&raw=1)

As I saw the firmware upgrade is finished, I **telnet**'ed into the router and saw that dd-wrt is already installed (so I went ahead and **reboot**ed the router):

	elatov@fed:~$telnet 192.168.1.1
	Trying 192.168.1.1...
	Connected to 192.168.1.1.

#### Clear the NVRAM in DD-WRT
After it rebooted, I pointed my browser to 192.168.1.1 and saw the initial DD-WRT set password page:

![ddwrt-installed](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/asus-dd-wrt/ddwrt-installed.png&raw=1)

I set the password, **telnet**'ed again into the router, and cleared the NVRAM:

#### Install the Kong DD-WRT Build
After the rebooted finished, I went back to the Admin Console (**http://192.168.1.1**) and navigated to **Administration** -> **Firmware Upgrade** to apply the DD-WRT Kong Build. I uploaded the **dd-wrt.v24-K3_AC_ARM_STD.bin** file and I chose **Don't Reset**:

![kong-firmware-dont-reset.png](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/asus-dd-wrt/kong-firmware-dont-reset.png&raw=1)

After I hit upgrade the uploaded started and after it finished I saw the "Upgrade Successful" message:

![upgrade-successful-kong_g.png](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/asus-dd-wrt/upgrade-successful-kong_g.png&raw=1)

After it rebooted (after applying the new dd-wrt build), I logged into router one more time and reset the NVRAM just for good measure:

	elatov@fed:~$telnet 192.168.1.1
	Trying 192.168.1.1...

### Install a Later Version of iproute2
I was using **fwbuilder** to push my firewall to the DD-WRT router (check out [my previous post ](/2013/04/use-fwbuilder-to-deploy-an-iptables-firewall-to-a-dd-wrt-router/)on the setup) and I wanted to keep that. I realized the **ip** utility (which is part of **iproute2** software) is limited, I could only get routes from the utility and nothing else:

	root@DD-WRT:~# /usr/sbin/ip addr show
	root@DD-WRT:~# /usr/sbin/ip rule ls
	root@DD-WRT:~# /usr/sbin/ip route ls
	default via 10.10.10.1 dev vlan2 
	10.0.0.0/24 dev vlan3  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.0.0.1 
	10.10.0/23 dev vlan2  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.10.10.1
	127.0.0.0/8 dev lo  scope link 
	192.168.1.0/24 dev br0  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.1.1 

But the **fwbuilder** script actually uses the `ip addr` functionality for some of it's components. There are actually a bunch of forums on this:

- [Does 'ip rule' work in latest DD-WRT builds?](http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=896793)
- [Dual WAN, selected traffic over second WAN (help needed!)](http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=781477)
- [/usr/sbin/ip not working in 18777](http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=162947)
- ['ip rule' command broken in 21676 mega](http://svn.dd-wrt.com/ticket/3033)
- [WZR-HP-G450H iproute2 tools](http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=256704)

One of them provides an **ip** binary but it's built for MIPS architecture and this new router runs on ARM. So I started to look elsewhere. At first I checked out the [Optware on K3-AC-ARM](http://dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Optware_on_K3-AC-ARM) and that recommended using an **openwrt** repository:

> "builds >23453 will use openwrt packages". The repository now in use is the OpenWRT imx6 repository, http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/imx6/packages/

After trying that repository I wasn't able to run the **opkg** binary. I then ran into [Kong 24500 for Arm Routers](http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=263675&sid=20d62bfad442096d789b358fdfa01040) and from that forum:

> 1. The build is based on 24500 but I added a few patches which show up in svn in later revisions. I just didn't want to sync anything from >24500 since I did all my testing with 24500 and only added fixes for things I found. This time I tested a lot more services and features.
> 
> 2. No uClibc anymore, thus any app that has been compiled for uClibc won't work now. A new repo with apps compiled against musl is up and you can install them through opkg. I removed ipkg and added a script that installs opkg for you. Before it was required to have one partition mounted to /jffs and one to /opt, now /opt is enough (/jffs is still recommended as it is the default location for override configs and storage space for things like webserver etc.).
> Bootstrap script will install opkg to /opt. Thus, if you already have a partition that is mounted to /opt, run the script "bootstrap". 

It looks there was a recent move to MUSL-ARM based packages and away from **uClibc**. More information on
that [here](http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=903789) as well. So when I used this repository:

>  http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/imx6/ 

It wouldn't run cause they are build against the **uClibc** library. There is also a **bootstrap** file on the router to setup the right repository. Here is what I did to install the right version of **optware** on the Asus RT-AC68U Router:

	root@DD-WRT:~# mkdir /jffs/opt 
	root@DD-WRT:~# mount --bind /jffs/opt /opt
	root@DD-WRT:~# bootstrap 
	Bootstrap is checking prerequisites...

	You did not enable USB automount.
	Echo optpart /dev/mtdblock/4 on /opt type jffs2 (rw,relatime)
	Found a valid partition: /opt.

	Proceed with download and install of opkg? (y/n) [default=n]: y
	Connecting to www.desipro.de (82.165.77.220:80)
	opkg.ipk             100% |**********************************************************| 56268   0:00:00 ETA
	Bootstrap complete. You can now use opkg to install additional packages.
	root@DD-WRT:~# which opkg

	Downloading http://www.desipro.de/bcm53xx-musl/packages/Packages.gz.
	Updated list of available packages in /opt/var/opkg-lists/kongac.

And here is what I ran to install the **iproute2** package:

	root@DD-WRT:~# opkg -f /opt/etc/opkg.conf install ip
	Installing ip (3.15.0-1) to root...
	Downloading http://www.desipro.de/bcm53xx-musl/packages/ip_3.15.0-1_bcm53xx.ipk.

After I installed the right one I saw the binary point to the **/lib/ld-musl-arm.so.1** file:

	root@DD-WRT:~# /opt/usr/bin/readelf -l /opt/usr/sbin/ip

While the non-working ones pointed to the **uClibc**:

	$readelf -l opkg

Just for reference here are the repository settings for the MUSL-ARM packages:

	root@DD-WRT:~# cat /opt/etc/opkg.conf 
	src/gz kongac http://www.desipro.de/bcm53xx-musl/packages
	dest root /opt
	dest ram /tmp
	lists_dir ext /opt/var/opkg-lists
	option overlay_root /overlay


After installing a newer version of **iproute2**, here is the output of **ip**:

	root@DD-WRT:~# /opt/usr/sbin/ip -4 a
	1: lo: <LOOPBACK,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default 
		inet 127.0.0.1/8 brd 127.255.255.255 scope host lo
		   valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
	5: vlan2@eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000

		   valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
	8: vlan3@eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default

		inet 192.168.1.1/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global br0
		   valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

Then on the **fwbuilder** side, I just pointed to the correct path of the **ip** utility:

![update-ip-path](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/asus-dd-wrt/update-ip-path.png&raw=1)

And then **fwbuilder** pushed the same settings without any issues.

### VLAN configs

For some reason I had some issues with this one. In [my previous post](/2014/04/tag-multiple-vlans-on-trunk-port-on-dd-wrt-router/) I ended using the **t** flag to signify that a VLAN will be tagged on a specific port (I basically ran this):

	nvram set vlan1ports="4t 3 2 1 8*"
	nvram set vlan3ports="4t 8"
	nvram set port4vlans="1 3 18 19"

But that didn't work on this version of the router/dd-wrt.  Here were the defaults, before I made any changes:

	root@DD-WRT:~# nvram show | grep vlan.port
	size: 30373 bytes (35163 left)
	vlan2ports=0 5u
	vlan1ports=1 2 3 4 5*
	root@DD-WRT:~# nvram show | grep port.vlan
	size: 30373 bytes (35163 left)
	port5vlans=1 2 16
	port3vlans=1
	port1vlans=1
	port4vlans=1
	port2vlans=1
	port0vlans=2
	root@DD-WRT:~# nvram show | grep vlan.hw
	size: 30373 bytes (35163 left)
	vlan2hwname=et0
	vlan1hwname=et0
	
I then read over the following pages:

- [Creating VLANs in DD-WRT (Part 1)](http://www.vspecialist.co.uk/creating-vlans-in-dd-wrt-part-1/)
- [Asus RT-AC66U, VLAN & WLAN](http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=773584)
- [DD-WRT heading two seperate networks](http://www.coertvonk.com/technology/networking/dd-wrt-heading-two-networks-asus-rt-ac68u-11717)

The last one has a nice picture to remind me how the networking worked on the dd-wrt Router:

![dd-wrt-internals2](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/asus-dd-wrt/dd-wrt-internals2.png&raw=1)

But the first two links used the **16** parameter on the (**portvlans** setttings), which is the equivilant of the **tagged** option checked on the GUI. So in the end, I ended up with the following config (notice I didn't even set the **vlan3ports**... but it still worked out):

	root@DD-WRT:~# cat /proc/vlan* | grep VID
	vlan1  VID: 1	 REORDER_HDR: 1  dev->priv_flags: 4001
	vlan2  VID: 2	 REORDER_HDR: 1  dev->priv_flags: 1
	vlan3  VID: 3	 REORDER_HDR: 1  dev->priv_flags: 1
	root@DD-WRT:~# nvram show | grep vlan.ports
	size: 34420 bytes (31116 left)
	vlan2ports=0 5u
	vlan1ports=1 2 3 4 5*
	root@DD-WRT:~# nvram show | grep port.vlan
	size: 34420 bytes (31116 left)
	port5vlans=1 2 3 16
	port3vlans=1
	port1vlans=1
	port4vlans=1 3 16
	port2vlans=1
	port0vlans=2
	root@DD-WRT:~# nvram show | grep vlan3
	mdhcpd=vlan3>On>100>50>3600
	size: 34420 bytes (31116 left)
	vlan3_netmask=255.255.255.0
	vlan3_txq=0
	vlan3_ipaddr=10.0.0.1
	vlan3_mtu=1500
	vlan3_multicast=0
	vlan3_nat=1
	vlan3_bridged=0

and that allowed me to use *tagged* vlans (**trunk** port) on the 4th port, just like before.
