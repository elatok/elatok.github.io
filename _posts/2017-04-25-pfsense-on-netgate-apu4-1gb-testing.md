I recently played around with AsusWRT and a 1Gb WAN connection and I was actually pretty happy with the results. Check out my [previous post](/2017/04/revert-to-asus-wrt-from-dd-wrt-on-asus-rt-ac68u-router/) on that. And I want to try the same thing on my pfSense firewall which was running on the Netgate APU4.

### Direct Speed Test
Plugging my laptop directly into the modem, I saw the following results:

![direct-laptop](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/apu4-wan/direct-laptop.png&raw=1)

Which I was pretty happy with.

### pfSense Speed Test
Adding pfSense into mix yielded the following results:

![pf-only-with-suricata](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/apu4-wan/pf-only-with-suricata.png&raw=1)

I started trying different things to see if that would help.

### TSO with Realtek RTL8111E 

Checking over the hardware, I saw the following:

	[2.3.2-RELEASE][root@pf.kar.int]/root: pciconf -lv re0@pci0:1:0:0
	re0@pci0:1:0:0:	class=0x020000 card=0x012310ec chip=0x816810ec rev=0x06 hdr=0x00
	    vendor     = 'Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.'
	    device     = 'RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller'
	    class      = network
	    subclass   = ethernet
	
	[2.3.2-RELEASE][root@pf.kar.int]/root: dmesg | grep re0    
	re0: <RealTek 8168/8111 B/C/CP/D/DP/E/F/G PCIe Gigabit Ethernet> port 0x1000-0x10ff mem 0xf7a00000-0xf7a00fff,0xf7900000-0xf7903fff irq 16 at device 0.0 on pci1
	re0: Using 1 MSI-X message
	re0: ASPM disabled
	re0: Chip rev. 0x2c000000
	re0: MAC rev. 0x00200000
	miibus0: <MII bus> on re0
	re0: Using defaults for TSO: 65518/35/2048
	re0: Ethernet address: 00:XX:XX:XX:XX
	re0: netmap queues/slots: TX 1/256, RX 1/256

I noticed that by enabling TSO, LAN speed actually went up. Before enabling TSO here are the results of a local **iperf** test:

	[2.3.2-RELEASE][root@pf.kar.int]/root: iperf -c 192.168.1.100 -w 2m
	------------------------------------------------------------
	Client connecting to 192.168.1.100, TCP port 5001
	TCP window size: 2.00 MByte (WARNING: requested 2.00 MByte)
	------------------------------------------------------------
	[  3] local 192.168.1.99 port 63862 connected with 192.168.1.100 port 5001
	[ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth
	[  3]  0.0-10.0 sec   873 MBytes   732 Mbits/sec


Then enabling TSO on the local LAN nic:

	[2.3.2-RELEASE][root@pf.kar.int]/root: ifconfig re1 | grep options
	       	options=8209b<RXCSUM,TXCSUM,VLAN_MTU,VLAN_HWTAGGING,VLAN_HWCSUM,WOL_MAGIC,LINKSTATE>
	       	nd6 options=21<PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL>
	[2.3.2-RELEASE][root@pf.kar.int]/root: ifconfig re1 tso
	[2.3.2-RELEASE][root@pf.kar.int]/root: ifconfig re1 | grep options
	       	options=8219b<RXCSUM,TXCSUM,VLAN_MTU,VLAN_HWTAGGING,VLAN_HWCSUM,TSO4,WOL_MAGIC,LINKSTATE>
	       	nd6 options=21<PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL>

BTW if you want to check supported features on the NIC you can run **ifconfig -m**

	[2.3.2-RELEASE][root@pf.kar.int]/root: ifconfig -m re1 | grep capa
	       	capabilities=1839db<RXCSUM,TXCSUM,VLAN_MTU,VLAN_HWTAGGING,POLLING,VLAN_HWCSUM,TSO4,WOL_UCAST,WOL_MCAST,WOL_MAGIC,LINKSTATE,NETMAP>
	       	
After enabling TSO, I saw the following:

	[2.3.2-RELEASE][root@pf.kar.int]/root: iperf -c 192.168.1.100 -w 2m
	------------------------------------------------------------
	Client connecting to 192.168.1.100, TCP port 5001
	TCP window size: 2.00 MByte (WARNING: requested 2.00 MByte)
	------------------------------------------------------------
	[  3] local 192.168.1.99 port 6017 connected with 192.168.1.100 port 5001
	[ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth
	[  3]  0.0-10.0 sec  1.07 GBytes   920 Mbits/sec
	
But unfortunately that didn't help with the LAN -> WAN speed.

### Other Performance Tweaks
Reading over [Tuning and Troubleshooting Network Cards](https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Tuning_and_Troubleshooting_Network_Cards), I tried some of the different settings, like increasing the **mbuf / nmbclusters** setting:

	kern.ipc.nmbclusters="131072"

But that didn't help. I also tried disabling and enabling the different options available in pfSense under **System** -> **Advanced** -> **Networking**:

![pf-net-options](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/apu4-wan/pf-net-options.png&raw=1) 

The following options didn't help:

* Disabling RXSUM and TXSUM
* Enabling Polling, rendered the nic down
* Enabling LRO
* Enabling PowerD

### Checking out the CPU Usage
Running **top -aSH** showed that NIC interrupts are high but not completely taking over the CPU:

![image](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/apu4-wan/pf-top-interr.png&raw=1)

Reading over the [FreeBSD forwarding Performance](https://bsdrp.net/documentation/technical_docs/performance), I tried using the **pmcstat** tool to see if **pf** is taking a lot of the kernel time, and when I ran the following:

	kldload hwpmc
	pmcstat -TS instructions -w1

The biggest user was **sbuf_bcat** (memory allocation):

	PMC: [FR_RETIRED_X86_INSTRUCTIONS] Samples: 2836 (100.0%) , 73 unresolved
	
	%SAMP IMAGE      FUNCTION             CALLERS
	 35.6 kernel     sbuf_bcat            sysctl_kern_malloc_stats:35.0 ...
	  3.5 kernel     pagezero             vm_fault_hold
	  2.4 kernel     pmap_remove_pages    vmspace_exit:1.5 exec_new_vmspace:0.9
	  2.0 kernel     copyout              copyout_nofault
	  1.4 libc.so.7  bsearch              0x64d4
	  1.4 kernel     vm_fault_hold        vm_fault
	  1.2 kernel     pmap_enter           vm_fault_hold
	  1.1 kernel     get_pv_entry         pmap_try_insert_pv_entry

and **pf** stayed pretty low.

	PMC: [FR_RETIRED_X86_INSTRUCTIONS] Samples: 12178 (100.0%) , 0 unresolved
	
	%SAMP IMAGE      FUNCTION             CALLERS
	 23.2 kernel     sched_idletd         fork_exit
	  6.1 kernel     pf_test              pf_check_out:3.3 pf_check_in:2.8
	  4.3 kernel     bzero                pf_test:1.7 pf_test_state_tcp:1.1 ...
	  3.3 kernel     pf_test_state_tcp    pf_test
	  3.0 kernel     __rw_rlock           bpf_mtap:0.9 in_localip:0.9

But still nothing in the high 70s for the percentage. 

I was also reading over the [PCEngines APU board with pfsense setup](https://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=77196.0) and decided to try out **powerd**. After enabling it, I couldn't run the **powerd** command, and it turned out to be a [known bug](https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/5739). After adding the following to the **/boot/device.hints** file, it started working:

	hint.acpi_throttle.0.disabled="0" 
	hint.p4tcc.0.disabled="0"  

After that you will also get more info from **sysctl**:

	[2.3.2-RELEASE][root@pf.kar.int]/root: sysctl dev.cpu.0
	dev.cpu.0.temperature: 57.0C
	dev.cpu.0.cx_usage: 100.00% 0.00% last 240us
	dev.cpu.0.cx_lowest: C1
	dev.cpu.0.cx_supported: C1/1/0 C2/2/100
	dev.cpu.0.freq_levels: 1000/-1 875/-1 750/-1 625/-1 500/-1 375/-1 250/-1 125/-1
	dev.cpu.0.freq: 1000
	dev.cpu.0.%parent: acpi0
	dev.cpu.0.%pnpinfo: _HID=none _UID=0
	dev.cpu.0.%location: handle=\_PR_.C000
	dev.cpu.0.%driver: cpu
	dev.cpu.0.%desc: ACPI CPU

And it should be running in the background:

	[2.3.2-RELEASE][root@pf.kar.int]/root: ps auwwx | grep power
	root    86054   0.0  0.0  14408  1956  -  Ss    7:57PM  0:00.06 /usr/sbin/powerd -b hadp -a max -n hadp

When I was running the speedtest I also ran **powerd** and here is what I saw:

	[2.3.2-RELEASE][root@pf.kar.int]/root: powerd -v
	load   4%, current freq  500 MHz ( 4), wanted freq  403 MHz
	load   0%, current freq  500 MHz ( 4), wanted freq  390 MHz
	load   7%, current freq  500 MHz ( 4), wanted freq  377 MHz
	load   0%, current freq  500 MHz ( 4), wanted freq  365 MHz
	changing clock speed from 500 MHz to 375 MHz
	load   0%, current freq  375 MHz ( 5), wanted freq  353 MHz
	load   3%, current freq  375 MHz ( 5), wanted freq  341 MHz
	load 113%, current freq  375 MHz ( 5), wanted freq 1364 MHz
	changing clock speed from 375 MHz to 1000 MHz
	load 104%, current freq 1000 MHz ( 0), wanted freq 2000 MHz
	load 135%, current freq 1000 MHz ( 0), wanted freq 2000 MHz
	load 132%, current freq 1000 MHz ( 0), wanted freq 2000 MHz
	load 132%, current freq 1000 MHz ( 0), wanted freq 2000 MHz
	load 138%, current freq 1000 MHz ( 0), wanted freq 2000 MHz
	load 138%, current freq 1000 MHz ( 0), wanted freq 2000 MHz
	load 148%, current freq 1000 MHz ( 0), wanted freq 2000 MHz
	load 142%, current freq 1000 MHz ( 0), wanted freq 2000 MHz
	load 172%, current freq 1000 MHz ( 0), wanted freq 2000 MHz
	load 154%, current freq 1000 MHz ( 0), wanted freq 2000 MHz
	load 160%, current freq 1000 MHz ( 0), wanted freq 2000 MHz
	...
	...
	load 148%, current freq 1000 MHz ( 0), wanted freq 2000 MHz
	load 160%, current freq 1000 MHz ( 0), wanted freq 2000 MHz
	load 154%, current freq 1000 MHz ( 0), wanted freq 2000 MHz
	load 169%, current freq 1000 MHz ( 0), wanted freq 2000 MHz
	load 154%, current freq 1000 MHz ( 0), wanted freq 2000 MHz

And the speedtest results were the same, looks like I need more CPU power.
### Other Resources

As I kept reading about the APU4 unit I ran into a bunch of folks that mentioned the same limitation:

* [Netgate Router Recommendation?](https://www.reddit.com/r/PFSENSE/comments/2vzy6t/netgate_router_recommendation/)

	> I've anecdotally heard the APU series is good for 500-600mbit/sec worth of NAT (at 100% CPU) and our own testing suggests it should be good for at least 30-40mbit/sec of VPN at AES128 (not using AES-GCM, projected based on CPU usage with our current WAN link). 

* [Throughput numbers for new SG-* devices?](https://www.reddit.com/r/PFSENSE/comments/348uho/throughput_numbers_for_new_sg_devices/)

	> We have the un-branded SG-2440 box and we pushed about 600mbit of our 1000mbit link through it before it pegged the CPU... it went a bit over 600 a few times, but never maxed out our link.

* [pfSense home router using the PC Engines APU1D4](http://www.sgvulcan.com/2015/08/27/pfsense-home-router-using-the-pc-engines-apu1d4/)

	> Throughput: without heavy use (squid, snort, etc.) you should see 400-500 Mbit WAN->LAN (limited by the realtek NICs). I know Mbit is not a good measure of a router/firewall performance but this is what matters to me at home. I saw mentions of 600 Mbit. I was eager to deploy it so I didn’t do any testing so all I can say is that 300Mbit works fine without any strain.

So after all my testing and actually enabling TSO (it helped with **suricata** offloading) this the best I could get (about **~530Mb** down):
