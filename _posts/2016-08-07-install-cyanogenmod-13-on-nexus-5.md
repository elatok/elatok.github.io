### Install ADB & Fastboot
I used MacPorts to install **adb**, most of the instructions are laid out in [MacPorts Install ADB](https://sskaje.me/2015/05/macports-install-adb/). First install the android sdk:

	sudo port install android

Then launch the **Android SDK Manager** and make sure to install **Android SDK Platform-tools**:


![and-man](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/cm-nexus_5/and-man.png&raw=1)

After that the binaries will be here:

	┌─[elatov@macair] - [/Users/elatov] - [2016-04-03 04:27:02]
	└─[0] <> ls -l /opt/local/share/java/android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools/{adb,fastboot}
	-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  _developer  1175964 Apr  2 08:46 /opt/local/share/java/android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools/adb
	-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  _developer   554816 Apr  2 08:46 /opt/local/share/java/android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools/fastboot

You can add that to the PATH variable or create symlinks in a directory which is in your PATH already.

### Enable USB Debug Mode on Nexus 5
The instructions are pretty simple, on the Nexus:

1. Go to **Settings** > **About Phone**
2. Tap **Build number** *7* times until it says “You are now a developer“.
3. Under **Settings** > **Developer Options**, set “USB debugging” to “On“.

Plug in the device and you should see the device:

	┌─[elatov@macair] - [/Users/elatov] - [2016-04-02 09:32:49]
	└─[0] <> adb devices -l
	List of devices attached
	06b       device usb:337X product:hammerhead model:Nexus_5 device:hammerhead

### Backup Phone
I usually use **adb** for the backup. But there are a bunch of different ways, first I backed up everything:

	┌─[elatov@macair] - [/Users/elatov] - [2016-04-02 09:20:34]
	└─[0] <> adb backup -f nexus5.ab -apk -shared -all
	Now unlock your device and confirm the backup operation.

And then I removed the system apps:

	┌─[elatov@macair] - [/Users/elatov] - [2016-04-02 09:28:05]
	└─[0] <> adb backup -f nexus5-no_sys.ab -apk -shared -all -nosystem
	Now unlock your device and confirm the backup operation.

The **backup** options are described [here](http://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-nexus/general/guide-phone-backup-unlock-root-t1420351). Here are the resulted files:

	┌─[elatov@macair] - [/Users/elatov] - [2016-04-02 09:42:17]
	└─[1] <> ls -lh *.ab
	-rw-r-----  1 elatov  1000   675M Apr  2 09:32 nexus5-no_sys.ab
	-rw-r-----  1 elatov  1000   923M Apr  2 09:28 nexus5.ab

### Unlock Phone
We can follow the instructions laid out in How to [Install CyanogenMod on the Google Nexus 5 ("hammerhead")](http://www.lineageosroms.org/nexus-5-cm-13-goes-official-and-here-is-how-to-flash/). First let's boot the phone into the fastboot mode:

	adb reboot bootloader

To confirm, we can run the following:

	┌─[elatov@macair] - [/Users/elatov] - [2016-04-02 09:59:44]
	└─[0] <> fastboot devices -l
	06b       fastboot usb:337X

Now let's unlock the device

	┌─[elatov@macair] - [/Users/elatov] - [2016-04-02 09:59:46]
	└─[0] <> fastboot oem unlock
	...
	OKAY [ 35.913s]
	finished. total time: 35.913s

The previous command will reset the phone to factory settings. So re-enable usb-debug mode after the phone resets.


### Install a Custom Recovery Image

I downloaded the recovery image and here is the file I ended up with:

	┌─[elatov@macair] - [/Users/elatov] - [2016-04-02 10:00:54]
	└─[0] <> ls -l download/twrp-2.8.7.1-hammerhead.img
	-rw-r--r--@ 1 elatov  1000  15046656 Apr  2 09:55 download/twrp-2.8.7.1-hammerhead.img

Now let's reboot into fastboot again:

	┌─[elatov@macair] - [/Users/elatov] - [2016-04-02 10:02:52]
	└─[0] <> adb reboot bootloader
	┌─[elatov@macair] - [/Users/elatov] - [2016-04-02 10:12:26]
	└─[0] <> fastboot devices -l
	06b       fastboot usb:337X

Now let's flash the recovery image onto the phone:

	┌─[elatov@macair] - [/Users/elatov] - [2016-04-02 10:12:40]
	└─[0] <> fastboot flash recovery download/twrp-2.8.7.1-hammerhead.img
	target reported max download size of 1073741824 bytes
	sending 'recovery' (14694 KB)...
	OKAY [  0.671s]
	writing 'recovery'...
	OKAY [  1.132s]
	finished. total time: 1.803s

Once the flash completes successfully, reboot the device into recovery to
verify the installation. To boot to recovery mode:

1. With the device powered down, hold the Volume Down and Volume Up buttons. Then press and hold the Power button until a boot menu appears. Navigate using the volume keys and select **RECOVERY MODE** using the Power key.
2. Or type in `adb reboot recovery`

After in recovery mode you will see a new recovery screen and you can confirm you are in recovery mode by running **adb devices**

	┌─[elatov@macair] - [/Users/elatov] - [2016-04-02 10:15:55]
	└─[0] <> adb devices
	List of devices attached
	06b	recovery

### Installing CyanogenMod from Recovery Mode

First download all the files:

	┌─[elatov@macair] - [/Users/elatov/download] - [2016-04-02 01:15:03]
	└─[0] <> ls -l *.zip *.img
	-rw-r--r--@ 1 elatov  1000  334188304 Apr  2 10:13 cm-13.0-20160316-SNAPSHOT-ZNH0EAO1QC-hammerhead.zip
	-rw-r--r--@ 1 elatov  1000  122494130 Apr  2 10:10 open_gapps-arm-6.0-nano-20160402.zip
	-rw-r--r--@ 1 elatov  1000   15046656 Apr  2 09:55 twrp-2.8.7.1-hammerhead.img

Now let's push the CyanogenMod and gapps onto the phone:

	┌─[elatov@macair] - [/Users/elatov] - [2016-04-02 10:15:59]
	└─[0] <> adb push download/cm-13.0-20160316-SNAPSHOT-ZNH0EAO1QC-hammerhead.zip /sdcard/
	4988 KB/s (334188304 bytes in 65.424s)
	
	┌─[elatov@macair] - [/Users/elatov] - [2016-04-02 10:18:31]
	└─[0] <> adb push download/open_gapps-arm-6.0-nano-20160402.zip /sdcard/
	4901 KB/s (122494130 bytes in 24.406s)

My phone was already in recovery mode, while in recovery mode I created a backup and reset the phone to factory settings:

![trec-backup-reset](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/cm-nexus_5/trec-backup-reset.jpg&raw=1)

Then I chose **Install** and first chose the **cm-13.0-20160316-SNAPSHOT-ZNH0EAO1QC-hammerhead.zip** file:

![team-rec-install-cm](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/cm-nexus_5/team-rec-install-cm.jpg&raw=1)

And after that was complete I then installed did the same with the **open_gapps-arm-6.0-nano-20160402.zip** file.

### Fix the Unauthorized Device
After the new install the devices showed up as *unauthorized*:

	┌─[elatov@macair] - [/Users/elatov] - [2016-04-02 01:40:06]
	└─[0] <> adb devices
	List of devices attached
	06b	unauthorized

To fix that, I moved the **.android** directory out of the way

	┌─[elatov@macair] - [/Users/elatov] - [2016-04-02 01:40:12]
	└─[0] <> sudo mv .android .android.orig

Then killed the adb server and tried again:

	┌─[elatov@macair] - [/Users/elatov] - [2016-04-02 01:41:17]
	└─[0] <> adb kill-server
	┌─[elatov@macair] - [/Users/elatov] - [2016-04-02 01:41:32]
	└─[0] <> adb devices
	List of devices attached
	* daemon not running. starting it now on port 5037 *
	* daemon started successfully *


At this point the pop up on the phone showed up and I accepted my Mac and then I saw the following:

	┌─[elatov@macair] - [/Users/elatov] - [2016-04-02 01:41:38]
	└─[0] <> adb devices
	List of devices attached
	06b	device

### Restoring from Backup
As I was resetting up the the phone, I had the option to restore all the apps from The Play Store (and I could choose which ones to install), this is only if you enabled backup to google:

![restore-phone-with-google](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/cm-nexus_5/restore-phone-with-google.png&raw=1)

That just installed the applications without any settings. Then I just restored from the adb backup for the actual data:

	adb restore nexus5-no_sys.ab
	
### Fix Broken Sound
I noticed that after some time the sound would stop working, I ran into [this](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/nexus/bBoE12HGm5U;context-place=topicsearchin/nexus/category$3Aother-discussions) thread and people fixed the issue by installing the [SoundAbout](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.woodslink.android.wiredheadphoneroutingfix&hl=en) App. I gave that a shot and so far do good.
