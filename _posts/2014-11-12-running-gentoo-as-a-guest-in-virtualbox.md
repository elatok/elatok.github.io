So I decided to do a test install of gentoo just to remind myself how fun it is :)

### Installing Gentoo
The process is definitely more involved then a regular Linux Distro install, but you get to learn a lot of things in the process. There are 3 good guides that helped me out:

- [Gentoo Linux amd64 Handbook: Installing Gentoo](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Full/Installation)
- [Quick install guide](http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Quick_install_guide)
- [Virtualbox Guest](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/VirtualBox)

#### Getting the Right Media
I was using a 64bit version so I grabbed the [ISO](https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/). After that I created a VM called **gentoo** in Virtualbox and Virtualbox autodetected the OS to be **gentoo** and took care of the rest. I gave the VM 1GB of ram and 20GB of disk space (VirtualBox set the Disk controller to be SATA and that worked out okay). I then attached the downloaded ISO to the IDE Controller:

![iso-attached-gentoo-vm](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/gentoo-in-virtualbox/iso-attached-gentoo-vm.png&raw=1)

Then powering on the vm and typing in `gentoo-nofb` booted from the livecd:


![gentoo-nofb-vm](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/gentoo-in-virtualbox/gentoo-nofb-vm.png&raw=1)

After the VM is booted I saw the following:

![gentoo-cd-booted](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/gentoo-in-virtualbox/gentoo-cd-booted.png&raw=1)

#### Enable SSH from the livecd
From here we can enable **ssh** just to make the install easier. So let's enable **ssh** and set the password from the *livecd*:

![ssh-enabled-live-cd](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/gentoo-in-virtualbox/ssh-enabled-live-cd.png&raw=1)

Now from virtualbox let's enable port forwarding so we can ssh from the host machine:

![port-forward-gentoo-vm](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/gentoo-in-virtualbox/port-forward-gentoo-vm.png&raw=1)

And then ssh from the host machine:

	elatov@fed:~$ssh -p 2244 -l root localhost
	The authenticity of host '[localhost]:2244 ([127.0.0.1]:2244)' can't be established.
	ED25519 key fingerprint is dd:eb:77:76:99:88:ab:64:f4:26:2a:cb:2b:04:c6:11.
	Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
	Warning: Permanently added '[localhost]:2244' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
	Password:
	Welcome to the Gentoo Linux Minimal Installation CD!
	
	The root password on this system has been auto-scrambled for security.
	
	If any ethernet adapters were detected at boot, they should be auto-configured
	if DHCP is available on your network.  Type "net-setup eth0" to specify eth0 IP
	address settings by hand.
	
	Check /etc/kernels/kernel-config-* for kernel configuration(s).
	The latest version of the Handbook is always available from the Gentoo web
	site by typing "links http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook.xml".
	
	To start an ssh server on this system, type "/etc/init.d/sshd start".  If you
	need to log in remotely as root, type "passwd root" to reset root's password
	to a known value.
	
	Please report any bugs you find to http://bugs.gentoo.org. Be sure to include
	detailed information about how to reproduce the bug you are reporting.
	Thank you for using Gentoo Linux!

#### Partition the Disk
Initially nothing is on the disk:

	livecd ~ # fdisk -l /dev/sda
	
	Disk /dev/sda: 20 GiB, 21474836480 bytes, 41943040 sectors
	Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
	Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
	I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

So let's create a 200MB boot partition and the rest will be used for an LVM:

	livecd ~ # fdisk /dev/sda
	
	Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.24.1).
	Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
	Be careful before using the write command.

	First sector (2048-41943039, default 2048):
	Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P} (2048-41943039, default 41943039): +200M
	
	Created a new partition 1 of type 'Linux' and of size 200 MiB.
	
	Command (m for help): n

	Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P} (411648-41943039, default 41943039):
	
	Created a new partition 2 of type 'Linux' and of size 19.8 GiB.
	
	Command (m for help): t
	Partition number (1,2, default 2): 2

	/dev/sda2         411648  41943039 20765696  8e Linux LVM
	
Now let's create the logical volumes:

	livecd ~ # vgscan
	  WARNING: lvmetad is running but disabled. Restart lvmetad before enabling it!
	  Reading all physical volumes.  This may take a while...
	  No volume groups found
	livecd ~ # pvcreate /dev/sda2
	  WARNING: lvmetad is running but disabled. Restart lvmetad before enabling it!
	  Physical volume "/dev/sda2" successfully created
	livecd ~ # vgcreate vg /dev/sda2
	  WARNING: lvmetad is running but disabled. Restart lvmetad before enabling it!
	  Volume group "vg" successfully created
	livecd ~ # lvcreate -L2G -n swap vg
	  WARNING: lvmetad is running but disabled. Restart lvmetad before enabling it!
	  Logical volume "swap" created
	livecd ~ # lvcreate -l100%FREE -n root vg
	  WARNING: lvmetad is running but disabled. Restart lvmetad before enabling it!
	  Logical volume "root" created
	livecd ~ # lvs
	  WARNING: lvmetad is running but disabled. Restart lvmetad before enabling it!

	  root vg   -wi-a----- 17.80g
	  swap vg   -wi-a-----  2.00g
	  
Now let's put appropriate filesystems on the logical volumes:

	livecd ~ # mkfs.ext2 /dev/sda1
	mke2fs 1.42.10 (18-May-2014)
	Creating filesystem with 204800 1k blocks and 51200 inodes
	Filesystem UUID: 7b6c019a-1509-4ee1-8858-24db713dbf48
	Superblock backups stored on blocks:
		8193, 24577, 40961, 57345, 73729
	
	Allocating group tables: done
	Writing inode tables: done
	Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done
	
	livecd ~ # mkfs.ext3 /dev/mapper/vg-root
	mke2fs 1.42.10 (18-May-2014)
	Creating filesystem with 4666368 4k blocks and 1166880 inodes
	Filesystem UUID: 6a20c3ad-c00c-4cea-ac6a-c48d171e12b8
	Superblock backups stored on blocks:
		32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912, 819200, 884736, 1605632, 2654208,
		4096000
	
	Allocating group tables: done
	Writing inode tables: done
	Creating journal (32768 blocks): done
	Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: mdone
	
	livecd ~ # mkswap /dev/mapper/vg-swap
	Setting up swapspace version 1, size = 2097148 KiB
	no label, UUID=40710598-2858-432b-9265-7a1b81412c26
	
The boot partition is ext2, cause we don't need to journal it. Now let's mount the file systems:

	livecd ~ # swapon -p 1 /dev/mapper/vg-swap
	livecd ~ # mount /dev/mapper/vg-root /mnt/gentoo/
	livecd ~ # mkdir /mnt/gentoo/boot
	livecd ~ # mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/gentoo/boot
	
#### Getting the Stage 3 files
From the gentoo mirrors I just grabbed the amd64 version:

	livecd ~ # cd /mnt/gentoo
	livecd gentoo # wget http://mirror.usu.edu/mirrors/gentoo/releases/amd64/current-iso/stage3-amd64-20141106.tar.bz2
	--2014-11-12 21:56:08--  http://mirror.usu.edu/mirrors/gentoo/releases/amd64/current-iso/stage3-amd64-20141106.tar.bz2

	livecd gentoo # time tar xjf stage3-amd64-20141106.tar.bz2

	real	0m37.671s
	user	0m18.770s
	sys	0m17.120s
	
That should extract most of the directory structure:

	livecd gentoo # ls
	bin   etc   lib32       media  proc  sbin                           tmp
	boot  home  lib64       mnt    root  stage3-amd64-20141106.tar.bz2  usr
	dev   lib   lost+found  opt    run   sys                            var
	
#### Chrooting into the Stage 3 Environment

Now that we have all the files let's **ch**ange **root** into our install:

	livecd gentoo # mount -t proc proc /mnt/gentoo/proc
	livecd gentoo # mount --rbind /dev /mnt/gentoo/dev
	livecd gentoo # mount --rbind /sys /mnt/gentoo/sys
	livecd gentoo # cp -L /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/gentoo/etc/
	livecd gentoo # chroot /mnt/gentoo /bin/bash
	livecd / # source /etc/profile
	
The networking was all good so we can get the portage snapshot:

	livecd / # ifconfig
	enp0s3: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500

	livecd / #

Now let's set the *timezone*:

	livecd / # cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Denver /etc/localtime
	livecd / # echo "America/Denver" > /etc/timezone
	livecd / # date
	Wed Nov 12 15:07:10 MST 2014

You can change your OS profile at this stage, but I just left mine as is:

	livecd / # eselect profile list
	Available profile symlink targets:
	  [1]   default/linux/amd64/13.0 *
	  [2]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/selinux

Now let's set our hostname:

	livecd etc # echo "127.0.0.1 gen.local gen localhost" > hosts
	livecd etc # sed -i -e 's/hostname.*/hostname="gen"/' conf.d/hostname
	livecd etc # hostname gen
	livecd etc # hostname -f
	gen.local

#### Kernel Configuration
First let's go ahead and get the kernel source:

	livecd etc # time emerge gentoo-sources
	
	real	2m1.159s
	user	0m39.270s
	sys	0m28.550s
	livecd etc # cd /usr/src/linux
	
Since we are using LVM for our root partition we have to make sure LVM is enabled:

	Device Drivers -->
		Multi-device support (RAID and LVM)  --->
		<*>   RAID support 
		[*]     Autodetect RAID arrays during kernel boot (NEW) 
		< >     Linear (append) mode (NEW)
		< >     RAID-0 (striping) mode (NEW)
		< >     RAID-1 (mirroring) mode (NEW)
		< >     RAID-10 (mirrored striping) mode (NEW)
		< >     RAID-4/RAID-5/RAID-6 mode (NEW)
		< >     Multipath I/O support (NEW)
		< >     Faulty test module for MD (NEW)
		< >   Block device as cache (NEW)
		<*>   Device mapper support

Also from the virtualbox page, we need the following:

	General setup  --->
	    Timers subsystem  --->
	        [*] Tickless System (Dynamic Ticks)
	        [ ] High Resolution Timer Support
	Processor type and features  --->
	    [X] Symmetric multi-processing support (keep this enabled for multiple cores, too!)
	    [X] SMT (Hyperthreading) scheduler support (This too, for i7's)
	    [ ] Machine Check / overheating reporting
	Power management and ACPI options  --->
	    [ ] Suspend to RAM and standby
	    [ ] Hibernation (aka 'suspend to disk')
	    [*] ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) Support  --->
	Device Drivers  --->
	    < > ATA/ATAPI/MFM/RLL support
	    <*> Serial ATA and Parallel ATA drivers
	        <*> AHCI SATA Support
	        [*] ATA SFF support
	        <*> Intel ESB, ICH, PIIX3, PIIX4 PATA/SATA support
	    [*] Network device support  --->
	        Ethernet driver support  --->
	            [*] AMD devices
	                <M>   AMD PCnet32 PCI support
	            [*] Intel devices
	                <M>   Intel(R) Pro/1000 Gigabit Ethernet support
	    Input device support --->
	        [*] Mice --->
	           <*> PS/2 mouse
	    Graphics support --->
	        <*> Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support)  --->
	            < > all options can be empty
	    <M> Sound card support --->
	        <M> Advanced Linux Sound Architecture --->
	            [*] PCI sound Devices --->
	                <M> Intel/SiS/nVidia/AMD/ALi AC97 Controller
	                
And for the compile options we need to add the following:

	INPUT_DEVICES="evdev"

Into **/etc/portage/make.conf** file. I can't live without **vim**, so I installed that as well (and used it to modify the **make.conf** file):

	livecd linux # time emerge vim
	real	2m1.949s
	user	1m20.620s
	sys	0m10.780s
	
Now to actually configure the kernel:

	livecd linux # make menuconfig

All of the above options were already enabled except the audio card:

![menu-config-audio-gentoo](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/gentoo-in-virtualbox/menu-config-audio-gentoo.png&raw=1)

As a side note, if you don't want to mess with the config, you can always just use the same config that the livecd is using. This can be accomplished with the following:

	livecd linux # make localyesconfig


After we configured our options for the kernel, let's actually build it:

	livecd linux # time make -j2
	..
	..
	  OBJCOPY arch/x86/boot/setup.bin
	  BUILD   arch/x86/boot/bzImage
	Setup is 15552 bytes (padded to 15872 bytes).
	System is 5529 kB
	CRC 666bb5f2
	Kernel: arch/x86/boot/bzImage is ready  (#1)
	
	real	11m8.265s
	user	9m43.780s
	sys	0m26.810s

About 20 minutes to build the kernel... that's not to bad. Now let's get all of our kernel modules:

	livecd linux # time make modules_install
	  INSTALL arch/x86/kernel/iosf_mbi.ko
	  INSTALL drivers/char/kcopy/kcopy.ko
	  INSTALL drivers/thermal/x86_pkg_temp_thermal.ko
	  INSTALL net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_MASQUERADE.ko
	  INSTALL net/ipv4/netfilter/iptable_nat.ko
	  INSTALL net/ipv4/netfilter/nf_nat_ipv4.ko
	  INSTALL net/netfilter/nf_nat.ko
	  INSTALL net/netfilter/nf_nat_ftp.ko
	  INSTALL net/netfilter/nf_nat_irc.ko
	  INSTALL net/netfilter/nf_nat_sip.ko
	  INSTALL net/netfilter/xt_LOG.ko
	  INSTALL net/netfilter/xt_mark.ko

	real	0m0.654s
	user	0m0.000s
	sys	0m0.010s

Lastly let's install the files into **/boot**:

	livecd linux # make install
	sh ./arch/x86/boot/install.sh 3.16.5-gentoo arch/x86/boot/bzImage \
		System.map "/boot"
	livecd linux # ls /boot
	System.map-3.16.5-gentoo  config-3.16.5-gentoo  lost+found  vmlinuz-3.16.5-gentoo

#### Building initramfs
First let's install the utility that can build the *initramfs* image:

	livecd linux # time emerge genkernel
	real	0m59.152s
	user	0m19.950s
	sys	0m11.470s

Here is how the build looked like:

	livecd linux # genkernel --install --lvm  initramfs
	* Gentoo Linux Genkernel; Version 3.4.49.2
	* Running with options: --install --lvm initramfs

	* Do NOT report kernel bugs as genkernel bugs unless your bug
	* is about the default genkernel configuration...
	*
	* Make sure you have the latest ~arch genkernel before reporting bugs.
	livecd linux # ls -1 /boot
	System.map-3.16.5-gentoo
	config-3.16.5-gentoo
	initramfs-genkernel-x86_64-3.16.5-gentoo
	lost+found
	vmlinuz-3.16.5-gentoo

Now we can see the **initramfs** image under **/boot** directory.

#### Installing the bootloader

The gentoo intructions go over **grub1** but now **grub2** is the latest one. So I strayed away from the regular instructions a little bit. First install the grub package (and by default the **grub2** package is used):

	livecd linux # time emerge grub
	real	3m0.380s
	user	1m45.110s
	sys	0m10.270s

It took about 5 minutes to build that guy. Here was the package it grabbed:

	livecd linux # equery list grub
	 * Searching for grub ...
	[IP-] [  ] sys-boot/grub-2.02_beta2-r2:2

I needed to install the **gentoolkit** package to get the **equery** tool. Now to install **grub** on the disk:

	livecd linux # grub2-install /dev/sda
	Installing for i386-pc platform.
	Installation finished. No error reported.

That will put the necessary files under **/boot/grub** and in the beginning of the disk:

	livecd linux # ls -1 /boot/grub/
	fonts
	grubenv
	i386-pc
	locale

Now to configure **grub** we first need to enable *lvm* on the **grub** config:

	livecd linux # grep ^GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX /etc/default/grub
	GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="dolvm"

and now to build the configuration:

	livecd linux # grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
	Generating grub configuration file ...
	Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.16.5-gentoo
	Found initrd image: /boot/initramfs-genkernel-x86_64-3.16.5-gentoo
	done

Notice it discovered the correct files under **/boot** and that's expected,  from [GRUB2 Quick Start](http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/GRUB2_Quick_Start):

> In order for grub2-mkconfig to detect your Linux kernel(s), they must be named vmlinuz-version or kernel-version


### Configuring the System
At this point we can probably reboot and it will should boot up. But before we do that let's enable system logging and other necessary components.

#### Configure /etc/fstab
We need to tell our system where swap is and other partitions as well, here is how my **/etc/fstab** file looked like in the end:

	livecd linux # grep /dev /etc/fstab
	/dev/sda1			/boot		ext2		noatime		1 2
	/dev/mapper/vg-root	/			ext3		noatime		0 1
	/dev/mapper/vg-swap	none		swap		sw			0 0

#### Configure Networking
I was using DHCP so just the bare minimum worked out:

	livecd linux # cd /etc/init.d/
	livecd init.d # ln -s net.lo net.enp0s3
	livecd init.d # echo 'hostname="gen"' > ../conf.d/hostname
	livecd init.d # rc-update add net.enp0s3 default
	 * service net.enp0s3 added to runlevel default
	livecd init.d # rc-update add sshd default
	 * service sshd added to runlevel default
	 
Let's set the password for root as well:

	livecd ~ # passwd
	New password:
	Retype new password:
	passwd: password updated successfully

#### Set the Clock
This is pretty easy, we just have to set the clock to local:

	livecd ~ # grep ^clock /etc/conf.d/hwclock
	clock="local"
	clock_args=""

#### Install System Utils
Let's install the **lvm** tools, since we are using that:

	livecd ~ # time emerge lvm2
	real	12m16.947s
	user	9m38.100s
	sys	1m12.650s

Since **boost** is a dependency of **lvm**, that's why it took so long to compile. Now let's enable that to run on boot:

	livecd ~ # rc-update add lvm boot
	 * service lvm added to runlevel boot

Now let's install **syslog** and **cron**:

	livecd ~ # time emerge syslog-ng vixie-cron
	real	1m16.452s
	user	0m41.960s
	sys	0m6.960s

And let's enable them as well to start on boot:

	livecd ~ # rc-update add syslog-ng default
	 * service syslog-ng added to runlevel default
	livecd ~ # rc-update add vixie-cron default
	 * service vixie-cron added to runlevel default
	 
Since Virtualbox uses DHCP let's install the DHCP client:

	livecd ~ # time emerge dhcpcd
	real	0m10.327s
	user	0m6.820s
	sys	0m0.910s

#### Leaving chroot and rebooting
So first let's leave the **chroot** and then unmount everything:

	livecd ~ # exit
	exit
	livecd gentoo # umount -l /mnt/gentoo/sys
	livecd gentoo # umount -l /mnt/gentoo/dev
	livecd gentoo # umount /mnt/gentoo/proc
	livecd gentoo # umount /mnt/gentoo/boot
	livecd gentoo # umount -l /mnt/gentoo
	livecd gentoo # poweroff
	livecd gentoo #
	Broadcast message from root@gen (pts/0) (Wed Nov 12 23:53:14 2014):
	
	The system is going down for system halt NOW!

I shut it off so I can remove the CD prior to booting the system back up:

![remove-iso-gentoo-vm](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/gentoo-in-virtualbox/remove-iso-gentoo-vm.png&raw=1)

### Post Install Configuration:
Upon booting up I saw the **grub2** menu:

![grub2-menu-gentoo-vm](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/gentoo-in-virtualbox/grub2-menu-gentoo-vm.png&raw=1)

Upon selecting the default menu, I saw *initramfs* loaded and the machine kept booting:

![gentoo-booting-up-lvm-loaded](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/gentoo-in-virtualbox/gentoo-booting-up-lvm-loaded.png&raw=1)

After it was done booting up, I saw the following:

![gentoo-booted-up](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/gentoo-in-virtualbox/gentoo-booted-up.png&raw=1)

If you try to SSH you will receive an "*Identification*" warning:

	elatov@fed:~$ssh -p 2244 -l root localhost
	@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
	@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
	@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
	IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
	Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
	It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
	The fingerprint for the ED25519 key sent by the remote host is
	76:40:84:d2:1a:41:3c:16:5d:43:e9:e8:7f:71:78:7e.
	Please contact your system administrator.
	Add correct host key in /Users/elatov/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.

	ED25519 host key for [localhost]:2244 has changed and you have requested strict checking.
	Host key verification failed.

And that's because when we **ssh**'ed last time we connected to the livecd and now we are **ssh**'ing into the actually gentoo install. To fix the warning, just remove the old host line from the **.ssh/known_hosts** and re-ssh into the machine:

	elatov@fed:~$ssh -p 2244 -l root localhost
	The authenticity of host '[localhost]:2244 ([127.0.0.1]:2244)' can't be established.
	ED25519 key fingerprint is 76:40:84:d2:1a:41:3c:16:5d:43:e9:e8:7f:71:78:7e.
	Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
	Warning: Permanently added '[localhost]:2244' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
	Password:
	gen ~ #

#### Build the locale
You can check the enabled locales like so:

	livecd ~ # eselect locale list
	Available targets for the LANG variable:
	  [1]   C
	  [2]   POSIX
	  [ ]   (free form)
  
I went ahead and enabled the US locales:

	gen ~ # grep -vE '^$|^#' /etc/locale.gen
	en_US ISO-8859-1
	en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8

and then generated them:

	gen ~ # locale-gen
	 * Generating 2 locales (this might take a while) with 1 jobs
	 *  (1/2) Generating en_US.ISO-8859-1 ... [ ok ]
	 *  (2/2) Generating en_US.UTF-8 ... [ ok ]
	 * Generation complete

And now I can see them on the list:

	gen ~ # eselect locale list
	Available targets for the LANG variable:
	  [1]   C
	  [2]   POSIX
	  [3]   en_US
	  [4]   en_US.iso88591
	  [5]   en_US.utf8
	  [ ]   (free form)

You can then set it with:

	gen ~ # eselect locale set 3
	
### Modifying the *make.conf* file
Here we can enable concurrent compilation processes:

	gen ~ # echo 'MAKEOPTS="-j2"' >> /etc/portage/make.conf

Then we can specify global options for building packages, this is done with the **USE** option. For example I don't use **ipv6** and I want to use **Xorg**, so I ended up with the following **USE** options:

	gen ~ # grep ^USE /etc/portage/make.conf
	USE="X -ipv6 bindist mmx sse sse2"

If you changed your **USE** flag, it's a good idea to rebuild everything with the new options:


	gen ~ # time emerge -vuD --newuse world
	real	18m23.146s
	user	12m42.519s
	sys	3m3.482s

#### Installing Xorg
There are pretty good instructions in [Xorg/Configuration](http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xorg/Configuration). We already had all the kernel options set and we had the **make.conf** settings configured as well (we had added the following to the **/etc/portage.make.conf** file):

	INPUT_DEVICES="evdev"

When I tried to install the package, I saw the following:

	gen ~ # emerge xorg-server
	
	 * IMPORTANT: 8 news items need reading for repository 'gentoo'.
	 * Use eselect news to read news items.
	
	..
	..
	The following USE changes are necessary to proceed:
	 (see "package.use" in the portage(5) man page for more details)
	# required by media-libs/mesa-10.0.4
	# required by x11-base/xorg-server-1.15.0[-minimal]
	# required by x11-drivers/xf86-video-virtualbox-4.2.24
	# required by x11-base/xorg-drivers-1.15[video_cards_virtualbox]
	=dev-libs/libxml2-2.9.1-r4 python
	
	Use --autounmask-write to write changes to config files (honoring
	CONFIG_PROTECT). Carefully examine the list of proposed changes,
	paying special attention to mask or keyword changes that may expose
	experimental or unstable packages.

It looks like we need to add the following line:

	=dev-libs/libxml2-2.9.1-r4 python

into the **/etc/portage/package.use** or we can just run **emerge** with the suggested options:

	gen ~ # emerge --autounmask-write xorg-server
	..
	..
	The following USE changes are necessary to proceed:
	 (see "package.use" in the portage(5) man page for more details)
	# required by media-libs/mesa-10.0.4
	# required by x11-base/xorg-server-1.15.0[-minimal]
	# required by x11-drivers/xf86-input-evdev-2.8.2
	# required by x11-base/xorg-drivers-1.15[input_devices_evdev]
	=dev-libs/libxml2-2.9.1-r4 python
	
	Autounmask changes successfully written.
	
	 * IMPORTANT: config file '/etc/portage/package.use' needs updating.
	 * See the CONFIGURATION FILES section of the emerge
	 * man page to learn how to update config files.

Looks like some configs are requiring some changes, so let's update the configs:

	gen ~ # etc-update
	Scanning Configuration files...
	The following is the list of files which need updating, each
	configuration file is followed by a list of possible replacement files.
	1) /etc/portage/package.use (1)
	Please select a file to edit by entering the corresponding number.
	              (don't use -3, -5, -7 or -9 if you're unsure what to do)
	              (-1 to exit) (-3 to auto merge all files)
	                           (-5 to auto-merge AND not use 'mv -i')
	                           (-7 to discard all updates)
	                           (-9 to discard all updates AND not use 'rm -i'):
	
	
	File: /etc/portage/._cfg0000_package.use
	1) Replace original with update
	2) Delete update, keeping original as is
	3) Interactively merge original with update
	4) Show differences again
	5) Save update as example config
	Please select from the menu above (-1 to ignore this update): 1
	Replacing /etc/portage/package.use with /etc/portage/._cfg0000_package.use
	
	Exiting: Nothing left to do; exiting. :)
	
Now that the changes are in place, let's compile the package:


	gen ~ # time emerge xorg-server
	real	41m53.748s
	user	33m49.628s
	sys	4m25.978s

(this took the longest to build). Now let's install **xterm** to test out if the Xorg Server can start up:

	gen ~ # time emerge xterm
	real	2m33.527s
	user	1m28.180s
	sys	0m28.255s

Then I just ran **startx** on the terminal and I saw the following:

![xorg-start-gentoo-vm](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/gentoo-in-virtualbox/xorg-start-gentoo-vm.png&raw=1)

#### Installing icewm
There are pretty good instructions on the setup at [IceWM Gentoo Package](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/x11-wm/icewm). The install itself is pretty easy:


	gen ~ # time emerge icewm
	real	3m38.742s
	user	2m29.740s
	sys	0m38.760s

From here we have some options. If we don't have a display manager we can just add the following

	exec icewm-session 

into **~/.xinitrc** and then running **startx** will start the icewm. Or we can install a display manager and it will auto detect it. I have used **lightdm** in the past and I liked it.

#### Installing lightdm
There are good instructions at [LightDM Gentoo Wiki](http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/LightDM). When I tried to install it it gave me a warning:

	gen ~ # time emerge lightdm
	The following USE changes are necessary to proceed:
	 (see "package.use" in the portage(5) man page for more details)
	# required by sys-auth/polkit-0.112-r2[-systemd]
	# required by sys-apps/accountsservice-0.6.37
	# required by x11-misc/lightdm-1.8.5
	# required by x11-misc/lightdm-gtk-greeter-1.6.1
	=sys-auth/consolekit-0.4.6 policykit
	
	Use --autounmask-write to write changes to config files (honoring
	CONFIG_PROTECT). Carefully examine the list of proposed changes,
	paying special attention to mask or keyword changes that may expose
	experimental or unstable packages.

So then I ran the following to configure the package.use file accordingly:

	gen ~ # emerge --autounmask-write lightdm
	The following USE changes are necessary to proceed:
	 (see "package.use" in the portage(5) man page for more details)
	# required by sys-auth/polkit-0.112-r2[-systemd]
	# required by sys-apps/accountsservice-0.6.37
	# required by x11-misc/lightdm-1.8.5
	# required by x11-misc/lightdm-gtk-greeter-1.6.1
	=sys-auth/consolekit-0.4.6 policykit
	
	Autounmask changes successfully written.
	
	 * IMPORTANT: config file '/etc/portage/package.use' needs updating.
	 * See the CONFIGURATION FILES section of the emerge
	 * man page to learn how to update config files.
	gen ~ # etc-update
	Scanning Configuration files...
	The following is the list of files which need updating, each
	configuration file is followed by a list of possible replacement files.
	1) /etc/portage/package.use (1)
	Please select a file to edit by entering the corresponding number.
	              (don't use -3, -5, -7 or -9 if you're unsure what to do)
	              (-1 to exit) (-3 to auto merge all files)
	                           (-5 to auto-merge AND not use 'mv -i')
	                           (-7 to discard all updates)
	                           (-9 to discard all updates AND not use 'rm -i'): -5
	Replacing /etc/portage/package.use with /etc/portage/._cfg0000_package.use
	Exiting: Nothing left to do; exiting. :)

And then the install went through:


	gen ~ # time emerge lightdm
	real	32m1.662s
	user	22m59.455s
	sys	5m15.219s

It took a while to compile cause it grabbed a bunch of gnome dependencies. I then ran the following to enable **lightdm** to autoload on boot:

	gen ~ # rc-update add dbus default
	 * service dbus added to runlevel default
	gen ~ # rc-update add xdm default
	 * service xdm added to runlevel default

After it's installed and enabled, we can set it as the default display manager by adding the following:

	DISPLAYMANAGER="lightdm"

into the **/etc/conf.d/xdm** file. Then restarting the machine auto loaded the lightdm login page:

![lightdm-loaded-gentoo](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/gentoo-in-virtualbox/lightdm-loaded-gentoo.png&raw=1)

and then after logging in as a regular user I saw icewm loaded:


![icevm-loaded-gentoo](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/gentoo-in-virtualbox/icevm-loaded-gentoo.png&raw=1)

After that you can run the following to keep your system up-to-date

	emerge --sync or emerge-webrsync
	emerge -avuDN --with-bdeps y --keep-going world
	emerge --depclean
	dispatch-conf or etc-update
