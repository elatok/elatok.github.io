**PF** (Packet Filter) is a BSD licensed stateful packet filter, a central piece of software for firewalling. It is comparable to **iptables**, **ipfw** and **ipfilter**.

Let's say you have the following physical setup:

![NAT](https://seacloud.cc/d/480b5e8fcd/files/?p=/pf_nat/NAT.jpg&raw=1)

And you want to use FreeBSD as your firewall and NAT'ing device, here is a small guide on how to set that up.

On your freebsd machine add the following into your **/etc/rc.conf** file:


	defaultrouter="100.138.196.1"  
	gateway_enable="YES"  
	hostname="thewall.domain.com"  
	ifconfig_xl0="inet 192.138.196.100 netmask 255.255.255.0"  
	ifconfig_bge0="inet 100.168.196.100 netmask 255.255.255.0"  
	ifconfig_xl0_alias0="inet 100.138.196.2 netmask 255.255.255.0"  
	ifconfig_xl0_alias1="inet 100.138.196.3 netmask 255.255.255.0"  
	ifconfig_xl0_alias2="inet 100.138.196.4 netmask 255.255.255.0"  
	pf_enable="YES"  
	pf_flags=""  
	pf_program="/sbin/pfctl"  
	pf_rules="/etc/pf.conf"  
	pflog_enable="YES"  
	pflog_flags=""  
	pflog_logfile="/var/log/pflog"  
	pflog_program="/sbin/pflogd"  
  
Reboot the host and check to make sure **pf** is running:

	ps aux | grep pf

then create the **/etc/pf.conf** file and place the following into the file:

After you have that all setup, you can use the following commands to test out your setup:  

- Parse Rules

		pfctl -nf /etc/pf.conf

- Load rules

		pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf

- Watch the logs for blocked packets

		tcpdump -n -e -ttt -i pflog0

The RHEL hosts behind the NAT should have the the following under **/etc/hosts**


	192.168.196.2 host1.domain.com host1  
	192.168.196.3 host2.domain.com host2  
	192.168.196.4 host3.domain.com host3  

and the following under **/etc/sysconfig/network**


	NETWORKING=yes  
	NETWORKING_IPV6=no  
	HOSTNAME=host#.domain.com  
	GATEWAY=192.168.196.100  

and of course set it's IPs as the private ip. 

I have also done a similar setup with **iptables**, and I will post my example on that next.
